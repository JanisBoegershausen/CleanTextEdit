# The Cleanest Text-Editor In Town
Welcome to this (so far unnamed) text editor. I started developing this because I tend to use windows default editor for taking temporary notes, and some writing, since I feel like the minimal design keeps me from getting distracted.
Since the default editor has no features though (especially no dark theme...), I decide to make this. A very clean, but functional, text editor for taking notes or writing documents. 

## Features
- Basic Text Editor
- "SaveAs..." & "Load..."
- "Save" (To save the opened file)
- Hotkeys: Ctrl-S, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+O
- Automatically open the last file on startup

## Todo
- Options window
- Option to toggle "stay on top"
- F3 -> Search
