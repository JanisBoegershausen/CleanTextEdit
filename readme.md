# The Cleanest Text-Editor In Town
Welcome to this (so far unnamed) text editor. I started developing this because I tend to use windows default editor for taking temporary notes, and some writing, since I feel like the minimal design keeps me from getting distracted.
Since the default editor has no features though (especially no dark theme...), I decide to make this. A very clean, but functional, text editor for taking notes or writing documents. 

## Features
- Basic Text Editor
- "SaveAs..." & "Load..."
- "Save" (To save the opened file)
- Hotkeys: Ctrl-S, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+O
- Automatically open the last file on startup
- Warning when trying to exit with unsaved text
- Autosaving
- Options window
- Option: Opacity
- Option: Toggle "Stay On Top"
- Option: Autosave toggle

## Todo
- F3 -> Search
- Custom scrollbar
- Option: Autosave interval
- Option: Start with windows
- Option: Toggle "Stay On Bottom"
- Option: Background & Foreground Colors
